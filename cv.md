### About My

I have very few jobs, I'm just at the beginning of the path. But I already have an understanding that this path will be passed more quickly on real tasks. 

I have no commercial experience in typesetting, only small training projects. But I make up for this with extensive experience in various industries and areas, a responsible approach to work, a clear understanding of what a deadline and "have to" are, the ability to work in a team, a black belt in soft-skills, and a huge potential for learning new things.
